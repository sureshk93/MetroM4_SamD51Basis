# Metro M4 SAMD51J19 Basis

This is something I created mainly to learn bare metal programming on the SAMD51J19 but
also with the hopes it can be used in custom boards and with uC of the same family. It may not
grow to anything but down the road it may, who knows.

As the name implies this is intended to be a code basis for this uC family with project I program for myself
and this specific code is written for the SAMD51J19 for the Metro M4 board by adafruit which I'm developing on.
